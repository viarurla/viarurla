- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @viarurla, I'm a UK based, self-taught programmer who has somehow created a professional career out of what once was a neat hobby of mine.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer hardware, gaming and discussing all things tech.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enhancing my existing skillset in Python and C# as well as some React/TS during my free time.
