- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @viarurla, I'm a UK based, self-taught programmer who has somehow created a professional career out of what once was a neat hobby of mine.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in new hardware, cool ways to automate the boring stuff and gaming too much.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SwiftUI and iOS development outside of my day job.
